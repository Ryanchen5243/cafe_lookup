This is one of the best Starbucks I've been to, 2
All the people here are so genuinely nice it's become a lovely place to relax and work and chat with them, 0
This is a great Starbucks to go to whether you want to grab a quick treat or sit down and study, 0
The drinks and staff are on parr with what Starbucks has to offer, 2
It's never too crowded and plenty of people are out with their laptops using the WiFi, 0
There are a lot of seats available and the baristas are fast, 0
It's a great place to do work or catch up with friends, 0
It gets crowded on weekends as early as 10am so come early to get a seat, 0
I recommend getting the Starbucks app so you can order ahead and not stand in line, 2
The staff is very friendly supportive and seem to enjoy working there, 2
They make great drinks like perfectly, 2
The atmosphere is a bit loud it's hard to study there, 1
Unfortunately there are not a lot of coffee shops in the area so this is what I'm left with, 2
I rated them a 1 because the music is always super loud and NOT conducive to getting work done, 1
The staff is not super friendly compared to many other locations I've been too, 2
The bathroom is always disgusting and they have a key pad on it which is annoying always having to ask for the password, 2
I love this place the music is not too loud, 0
The atmosphere is great for business work study reading, 0
Very crowded and vibey on a Sunday afternoon, 2
Great spot to catchup or work if you can find a table, 0
Fun draft cold brews but even the black iced coffee is good, 2
Line moves quickly, 2
Totally loved this place, 2
Spacious (ergo lots of seating) and they serve great coffee, 0
Probably not very relevant but cups are also quite pretty, 2
There's good lighting coming from the outside and it's a great place for having a chat w friends or reading your book, 0
Good service, 2
No WiFi and quite noisy usually so would not recommend if you want somewhere to work, 1
Drinks ok nothing special slightly higher than average price but nothing too crazy, 2
Where I started my morning with a cup of their coffee, 2
This location has plenty of seating that can be hanging out with friends and having a nice cup of coffee, 0
I like their out door seating as well to enjoy a little bit of the sunshine, 2
Great spot in a great neighborhood, 2
Friendly staff and quick service, 2
Comfortable seating in very pleasant atmosphere, 0
I'm in this area frequently so very happy to have a go to spot, 2
And Delicious coffee Including my perfectly done cup of Americano, 2
Delicious chai latte, 2
Tiffany was lovely my phone was dying & my charger wasn't working so she took my phone & charged it in her office, 2
Much appreciated and unlikely to have happened at some of the better known large chains, 2
Excellent customer service tasty beverage good atmosphere, 2
This place has a really good selection of coffees brews and other food items, 2
Coffee is at the heart of what they do and the baristas are generally friendly, 2
Prices are normal nothing low or high and options are a plenty, 2
Good enough space to get some work done with outlets but no wifi unfortunately, 0
During the weekend it can get a bit loud and some days it feels like they close before 6 PM so beware of that, 1
I visited this place 2 days ago around 1pm a cashier who received my order didn't seem to know much about coffee, 2
I had to repeat my order to the other cashier making a payment to finish my order because the one before just went his way after he received my order., 2
Also the 2nd cashier was unfriendly and rude when i made a payment, 2
I ordered a cortado and it has to have a little but of foam or no foam at all but a barista brought me a cappuccino, 2
Temperature of the milk was so bad it was just lukewarm, 2
I couldn't smell any aroma nor body nor flavour from another of espresso shot, 2
It just tasted burnt and that's it, 2
I took a sip of it and threw it away, 2
Such a waste of money and time horrible experience over all, 2
Good coffee basic pastry only one toilet often busy and NO Wi-Fi, 1
This is NOT the place to study, 1
It's so loud and there's NO wifi and NO outlets, 1
The tables are also way too small, 1
It's more of a talking cafe than a study cafe, 1
The only nice thing is that you might see a celebrity since they tend to frequent this location, 2
I ordered an oat milk cappuccino and a croissant and both were excellent, 2
This is the perfect place to get some work done, 0
If you want to get overpriced coffee at a place that will ignore you have a bad attitude when they finally deign to talk to you and then roll your eyes when you ask a question then this is your place, 2
Also the coffee sucks, 2
Do yourself a favor and go literally anywhere else, 2
Hands down the best coffee I have ever tasted, 2
And that's an amazing statement considering how many places there are or there, 2
Main issue I had was the table size way to small to get any real work done, 1
The chairs also don't have backrests, 1
So if you want to get trendy coffee come here if you want to do work go somewhere else, 1
A busy spot but a fun line and delicious coffee, 2
Great picture Windows for people watching and seating for meetings and work, 0
Highly recommend if you are in the neighborhood and need a caffeine boost, 2
Got two large coffees…wanted to make sure I was actually received a large coffee since the cup size seemed small, 2
After saying “excuse me” 5 times to the person who took my order but was blatantly ignoring since I've already paid another coworker who now seemed annoyed fnally addressed me, 2
In the heart of SoHo this place is the best coffee shop to sit e and rest, 0
We got an iced coconut latte and a honey rose latte tlovely staff offered us a banana muffin and a chocolate chip cookie, 2
All was delicious and we cannot wait to come back, 2
Lil expensive but the vibe is RIGHT, 2
I love a good remote working spot WITH OUTLETS and this is one of my go-to's, 0

The space is quite aesthetic and the vibes are great, 2
There's a projector showing a movie on the wall and there is a lot of seating, 0
The wifi is reliable and there is a restroom, 0
An ideal spot to sit down for a little bit and unwind, 0
A place with good coffee beverages but full to the brim with people working on their laptops or running teleconferences, 0
Barely having one drink in front of them or having just left their stuff at a table nowhere to be seen, 2
I paid north of $20 plus tip for 2 coffees and a bottle of water and when I tried to sit on a chair at the bar I was told by the staff This is not a seat, 2
Really nice coffee options and good selection of pastries, 2
The coffee shop is very deep so there are a lot of seats however must of the people come here with a laptop and stay for long so it's probably you won't find a seat, 0
I worked here and it's a really good option, 0
The wifi was good they have a lot of power outlets, 0
Maybe only don't come if you need to take calls because it's very loud, 1
The Lost Draft has good coffee plenty of seating reliable wifi a bathroom and is open till 9pm and laptop-friendly, 0
It's nearly impossible to find that combination in a coffee shop in New York, 2
Coffee here is a tad more expensive but given everything I listed above it makes sense, 2
Definitely recommend if you want a place you can reliably work from, 0
People who work here don't look like they want to be here - no customer mind at all, 2
Toilet needs a code and no tissue in there, 2
Dirty - I see waiters just sweeping tissue sticking to the floor to clean the table, 2
But I mean it's Starbucks so drinks are ok, 2
Calm and a wide space than other NY starbucks, 0
And very powerful airconditioner, 2
Electric bay under table It was really nice for laptop work, 0
This is a large store with plenty of seating, 0
The staff was friendly, 2
Beautiful cafe with very nice atmosphere, 0
Very well managed great food delicious coffee and everyone that works there is super nice, 2
I come here every day to get my latte, 2
They also have an outdoor patio where you will see a lot of people working with their laptops, 0
I really appreciate the laptop room, 0
It's very busy on a Friday but I managed to get a seat, 0
The wifi is good and the coffee is decent but expensive ($4.50 for a black coffee), 0
They have lots of baked goods and a gluten free loaf, 2
They look fine but not spectacular, 2
A clean washroom too, 0
The cafe is pretty chill, 2
They have a good selection of croissants (ham and cheese chocolate plain) among other pastries, 2
I ordered a chocolate croissant which I thought needed some some warming through love but over was good, 2
The iced mocha was good, 2
Good to come early to get a good spot, 0
A lot of people have their laptops to work so space gets very limited, 0
Very nice cozy café with a few tables out front and a very welcoming backyard patio, 0
Ideal environment to work on your laptop: quiet fast wifi power outlets ample room, 0
Very French-friendly as well with lots of French music playing and many francophones hanging out here, 2
good coffee bad for working, 1
harsh “no laptop” policy they should advertise to paying customers, 1
I don't understand this “war on productivity” certain cafes have adopted, 1
Wasn't aware of the new rule restricting laptops in the front room on weekends was asked to find a new seat in the back which is fine, 1
There were limited seats in the back and most were located outside under a haze of smoke, 1
I'm asthmatic and got some attitude from a server for taking one of the indoor seats in the back since I can't be amongst the smoke, 2
I understand the idea behind the rule but there were just a bunch of empty seats in the front and didn't appreciate the lack of compassion, 2
This Starbucks is right downstairs from me so I tend to go here VERY OFTEN, 2
I love it as it is clean and has plenty of seating, 0
They tend to have ample staff so orders come out fast and correct, 2
If you are a regular the staff will learn your name and greet you by name when you come in, 2
If it is on the slower side they are very friendly and are happy to chat for a minute, 2
Quaint neighborhood coffee shop, 2
4 stars because they allow dogs inside, 2
Patrons are friendly - ask if you can share a table when all the seating is filled, 0
A little noisy but almost all the seating by the outlets are underneath the speakers, 0
Otherwise good place to get out of the house and get some work done, 0
Bring a good set of noise-cancelling headphones, 0
I stayed here for hours, 0
Wifi took forever to stay connected like eventually it might depend on where you sit, 1
Did overhear barista tell to another customer that best place to stay is the inner part when she asked, 2
I forgot my baristas name but I'm glad she paid attention to details because I forgot to mention my milk preference, 2
Cute coffee shop offering drinks and food but limited seating, 1
Really tiny cafe with good coffee, 1
The just have small bar tables with like 5 seats, 1
This place is best for a grab and go coffee but I did work from here, 1
It was hard but not impossible, 2
Staff are super friendly and area is busy, 2
Place is too tiny I dont think is 4.5 my rate would be solid 3.9 and I wouldn't waste my vacation breakfast fun in here, 1
Very nice small place, 1
Really cool different atmosphere but they had no seating which was a bummer and the drinks weren't quite as warm as I would've liked them to be however I was a bit on the frozen side so that could've been my fault, 1
I know that New York but this is a grab and go type of place in my opinion, 1
Music was terribly loud and obnoxious, 1
They have no where to sit and eat which is what I like to do, 1
The space is elegant and spacious with a premium feel compared to regular Starbucks outlets, 0
Has about 5 small tables inside quiet and great, 1
There were a couple of small benches and tables infrint of the shop where you can sit and enjoy your morning coffee, 1
Prices are Great and ample seating space inside and outside, 0
Charming place but no bathroom and no laptops allowed due to restaurant week, 1
Not a lot of indoor seating but it's near a park so you can just chill outside after getting your drink, 1
This place is more tailored for grab and go, 1
It's literally a sliver of a room with no chairs and tables to attend to so it's bizarre just how inefficient this location is, 1
Space is nice for a meet up but a bit cramped for work, 1
Relax seating and evironment, 0
The seating is comfortable and the atmosphere is relaxing, 0
While the space is compact there are a few tables available for seating though laptop use is generally discouraged, 1
Suited is a great spot in FiDi to sip a variety of drinks (coffee-based and non) while doing some work or having a break with a pastry, 0
Such a gem of a cafe, 2
The staff is incredibly friendly and welcoming creating a warm and inviting vibe the moment you walk in, 2
The coffee is absolutely fantastic — rich flavorful and perfectly brewed, 2
The hospitality here is truly overwhelming; you can feel how much they care about their customers, 2
Highly recommend this place for anyone looking for great coffee and a cozy atmosphere, 2
It's a really great spot to catch up with a friend grab a coffee or just work, 0
there's so much seating, 0
I've been living in New York for 6 years now and let me tell you this place serves hands down the best coffee I've ever had, 2
But it's not just about the coffee—the vibe here is unbeatable, 2
It's one of the rare spots where I actually feel comfortable sitting down and staying a while, 0
The noise level is just right the art on the walls is thoughtful and the whole atmosphere is super chill, 0
Perfect place to unwind or get some work done, 0
If you go I highly recommend making anything barrel-aged, 2
It's an absolute must-try, 2
I've tried quite a few of their more eclectic drinks but my absolute favorite is their seasonal Wake & Bake — served iced barrel-aged with oat milk, 2
Sidebar: their chocolate is also dope, 2
Great place to do laptop stuff work or study, 0
This place is spacious with a vibe that perfectly captures the feeling of the east village, 0
Spacious they could fit a lot more tables in there if they wanted, 0
Current favorite coffee shop. Lots of tables great coffee and great service, 0
Matcha was great and good wifi and clean restroom, 0
The matcha here is packed with bold authentic flavor—just what I wanted, 2
I tried the Straight Up Double Matcha Cold Foam and Pistachio Rose Cardamom Cake, 2
The cake was rich and moist but not overly heavy making it the perfect treat, 2
Everything was so good I'll definitely come back whenever I'm craving matcha, 2
This is the most ridiculous place, 2
Nonwhere to sit except out side in the sun, 1
With ample seating and calming background music it's an excellent spot to relax or get some work done, 0
CupSoul Cafe is a true haven offering a comfortable spacious and airy environment perfect for enjoying your favorite coffee, 0
Indulge in a vibrant array but not overwhelming selection of delicious donuts or savor a perfectly sized and wholly delicious sandwich, 2
WiFi is very slow though but it's nice they offer it, 1
There isn't room inside to sit and they only have one bench outside for seating but there's an entire park on the other side of the street where there's plenty of seating, 1
Small little coffee shop the barista was very nice, 1
Charming small local café—great spot for a quick stop if you're in the area, 1
I dropped in to this cafe to work remotely and there were hardly any outlets to charge my laptop, 1
Of the few available only one of them actually worked, 2
But I find it crowded and dark, 1
Small space perfect for a quick stop, 1
Super cute small coffee shop to have a chat with a friend and catch up, 1
I wouldn't recommend coming here to do work since it's always packed and could be quite noisy but for a quick sit down or grab and go its ideal, 1
